For the driver's list, it should be in the format of:

  * Driver's Name (After comes a COMMA).
    
  * Location, This can be in any way you want but you generally want it to be in the way the user will input the  restaurant location and also theirs (After comes a COMMA).

  * And load which is the numbers at the end of each driver's line.
